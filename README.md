# Uniswap Code Structure Replica

This repository showcases a project that replicates the code structure of Uniswap, one of the largest and most popular **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**. The project is based on the "Programming DeFi" article series by [Ivan Kuznetsov](https://github.com/Jeiwan) and can be found [here](https://jeiwan.net/posts/programming-defi-uniswap-1/).

## About Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) are platforms that facilitate peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. They operate on decentralized networks and use smart contracts to enable direct transactions between users, providing greater privacy, security, and control over assets compared to centralized exchanges.

### Key Concepts

- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In DEX, smart contracts automate trade settlements and ensure trustless transactions.

- **Liquidity Pools**: Pools of tokens locked in smart contracts that facilitate decentralized trading. Liquidity providers contribute tokens to these pools and earn fees in return.

- **Automated Market Makers (AMM)**: Algorithms that determine token prices based on the ratio of tokens in liquidity pools. Uniswap, for example, uses an AMM model to enable continuous liquidity provision.

## Using the Foundry Framework

Unlike the original repository, this project is adapted to utilize the Foundry framework (https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Foundry is a modern web framework for Rust, designed for building fast and reliable web applications with minimal boilerplate code.

## Replicating this Repository Locally

To replicate this repository on your local machine, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:igorlnunes/dex_learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dex_learning
    ```

3. Follow the setup and installation instructions provided in the README or documentation of the Foundry framework to configure and run the project locally.

Now you can explore and experiment with the Uniswap code structure replica using the Foundry framework in your local development environment!
